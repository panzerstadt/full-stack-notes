## 1. react (native?) + game design
### pitch
name: epic todolist!
what it does: game effects and reactions in a todolist. all actions have an epic feeling to it, from screneshake to flashes of colour (like slashing)

### description
you are an adventurer entering a cave with a band of warriors, and you've walked into a trap. he cave is actually the jaws of a dragon (or jaws of time XD)! to exit, you have to complete tasks on your todo list

### generating the todo list

![sketches](./images/epic-todolist-01.JPG)


#### general effects with interactive objecs
- like the css toggle, colourful, low input high output effects

#### adding an item
- EFFECT: every keypress has flashes of light or 

#### setting a timer
- drag down to set (not a lienar setting, but easing in-out-in)
- general time between 10 min and 50 mind (other times can be set, but they are toward the beginning or end of drag)
- EFFECT: sound effect like prison doors closing when you let go
- EFFECT: as you drag down, colours change and screenshakes

#### while not interacting with todo list
- little pixel warrior slashing at the jaws to no avail (animated)

#### checking done on a todo item
- performs an attack on the jaws
- EFFECT: colourful flashes on screen as a slash is performed
- racks up time saved as 'damage'
- provides interesting ways to do stuff with the time saved

#### notifications
- sets up a reminder for every task and breaktime

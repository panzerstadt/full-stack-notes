# SASS / SCSS

> SASS: We have extended css to make it DRY

> Bitters: We have a clear folder structure for you

	Quote:

	After some time of getting used to it, you'll appreciate Bitters more and more: its default structure suggests a place for almost everything. Especially when working in a team, it's great to simply know where things are defined - instead of having to search and wonder.

### variables
- store colors, font stacks, or any css value you think you want to reuse
- use $ to turn it into a variable

```css
$font-stack: Helvetica, sans-serif;

$primary-color: #333;

body {
	font: 100% $font-stack;
	color: $primary-color;
}
```

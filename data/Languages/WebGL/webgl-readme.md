# WEBGL
- tool for rendering interactive 2D and 3D graphics without any plugins
- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API

	Support for WebGL is present in Firefox 4+, Google Chrome 9+, Opera 12+, Safari 5.1+, Internet Explorer 11+, and Microsoft Edge build 10240+; however, the user's device must also have hardware that supports these features.

	The <canvas> element is also used by Canvas 2D to do 2D graphics on web pages.

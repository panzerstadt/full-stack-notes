## javascript history
- https://codeburst.io/javascript-wtf-is-es6-es8-es-2017-ecmascript-dca859e4821c
Hereâ€™s what happened long, long ago:
1. JavaScript was originally named JavaScript in hopes of capitalizing on the success of Java.
2. Netscape then submitted JavaScript to ECMA International for Standardization. (ECMA is an organization that standardizes information)
3. This results in a new language standard, known as ECMAScript.
4. Put simply, ECMAScript is a standard. While JavaScript is the most popular implementation of that standard. JavaScript implements ECMAScript and builds on top of it.

## how to run javascript
- on the browser - use the browser
	- [quora](https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-run-a-JavaScript-file)
	1. use [jsbin](http://jsbin.com/?html,output)
	2. save the file as .HTML, .HTM and open in google chrome, right click, inspect element, and click console. You should be able to see the results of your code running.

- off the browser - use node.js
	- in terminal: **node myapp.js**


## NODEJS

>just like when you do ***python myapp.py*** in terminal,
> now you can do ***node myapp.js*** in terminal.

> apparently you couldn't before.

[eli5](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnjavascript/comments/3d4hs5/eli5_what_in_the_heck_is_nodejs/?st=jedngbld&sh=7bd840a1)
- a lightweight server that allows you to run Javascript outside the browser
- perform actions on your local machine
- has the ability to run HTTP applications written in Javascript
	- essentially doing what Apache httpd does (meaning Node.js acts like a webserver)
- meaning, there are now applications using Javascript to run front end ***AND*** backend.
- but Node is single threaded, so its not super fast

	The main advantage is the asynchronous nature of the language, which is caused by the single-threaded event-loop, which is a fancy way of saying "I can schedule a bunch of jobs simultaneously, and I'll be able to answer them as soon as they are done processing - no job that is done will have to wait around for me to get around to it because I'll know instantly".

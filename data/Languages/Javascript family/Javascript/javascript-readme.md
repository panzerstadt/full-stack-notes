## javascript history
- https://codeburst.io/javascript-wtf-is-es6-es8-es-2017-ecmascript-dca859e4821c
Hereâ€™s what happened long, long ago:
1. JavaScript was originally named JavaScript in hopes of capitalizing on the success of Java.
2. Netscape then submitted JavaScript to ECMA International for Standardization. (ECMA is an organization that standardizes information)
3. This results in a new language standard, known as ECMAScript.
4. Put simply, ECMAScript is a standard. While JavaScript is the most popular implementation of that standard. JavaScript implements ECMAScript and builds on top of it.

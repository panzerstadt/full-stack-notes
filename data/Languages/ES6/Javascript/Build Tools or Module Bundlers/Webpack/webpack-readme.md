# WEBPACK

## what is Webpack?
- another module bundler to turn fancy javascript / react stuff into standard Javascript
- module bundlers are needed to make things work because it turns all the pre-Javascript `react` and `nodejs` code into **runnable** Javascript.

Webpack seeks to unify Javascript module syntaxes and provide tools for a full swath of static asset management tasks. It imposes no restrictions on your choice of module syntax, and offers full support for Javascript, CSS, and even image preprocessing.

# OAuth 2.0
||| future

Oauth Is based around the idea of not sharing usernames and passwords when sharing data between apps/websites. Instead of needing the user to key in site A’s username and password into site B to let site B get stuff from site A (dangerous because site B now has site A’s password), site B sends the user to site A to type the user/pw and then allow the user to decide how much permission to give site B, before sending the user back to site B.
- Prevent password sharing
- More adjustable permissions (types of data allowed to access, time allowed to access)
